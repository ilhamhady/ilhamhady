# Hi there! I'm Muhammad Ilham! 👋

## A little bit about me 🌎

Hello from the beautiful Jimbaran, Bali! Originally from Surabaya, my journey led me here in August 2019, and I haven't looked back since. I've been a Digital Marketing Consultant for a leading wedding organizer company in Bali, and guess what? I loved every bit of it!

But you know what I love even more? **Web development** and **coding journey!** That's why I'm thrilled to share that I'm now rocking as a [Frontend Engineer](https://github.com/ilham-fetchly) at [Fetchly Labs](https://www.fetch.ly), a data-driven startup based in Denver, USA, that's revolutionizing how businesses connect with customers.

### A Snapshot of My Journey So Far 🚀

I'm a firm believer that every day is a chance to learn, to challenge oneself, and to step out of the comfort zone. It's this ethos that's shaped my career journey, and let me tell you, it's been quite an adventure!

- **Web Development Guru**: Constructed over 10 websites from scratch, each adding a unique perspective to my approach.
- **Government Collaborations**: Had the opportunity to be part of noteworthy government website projects, adding a valuable dimension to my experience.
- **WordPress Wizard**: I have a few personal-use WordPress plugins to my name - just another way I love to explore the endless possibilities of coding!
- **Startup Strides**: Currently making waves at my position at Fetchly Labs, I've had my hands in over 10 impactful web and mobile app projects, shaping the digital face of businesses.

Each of these milestones has enriched my journey, shaping me into a versatile, solution-oriented developer. Every challenge sparks an opportunity, every roadblock is just a puzzle waiting to be solved – and I am all for it!

## On a Personal Note 😄

When I'm not elbow-deep in code, I love learning new programming languages (Python is my current learning path), diving into a new anime series (currently hooked on Solo Leveling), or just chilling with family and friends at coffee shops (I'm an cappuccino guy), beaches, or malls. Life is all about balance, right?

## Future Goals 🎯

Looking ahead, my ambition is to build web and mobile apps that can be game-changers for small businesses. There's so much potential out there, and I can't wait to explore it.

## Coffee Chat Topics ☕️

Speaking of coffee, I absolutely love deep-diving into conversations about:

- **Programming**: From JavaScript and TypeScript to Next JS, React, and React Native – let's talk!
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, and WordPress? Count me in!
- **Web Design & Performance**: I'm all about creating and fine-tuning until it's just right.
- **Digital Marketing**: Social Media Marketing, funneling, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - I've got loads to share!
- **AI Coding Tools & Frameworks**: I'm a fan of AI coding tools and frameworks like OpenAI, Claude, Deepseek, Ollama, Open WebUI, Lovable, and more. What's your favorite AI tool?
